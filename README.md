# FARMIND (FARM INteraction and Decision)
This is an agent-based model for the simulation of farm level decision-making developed by the Agricultural Economics and Policy Group at ETH Zurich (www.aecp.ethz.ch).

The model represents each farm as an agent as well as a node in social networks. Each agent chooses a strategy for perform activities based on the satisfaction and uncertainty about its output. A set of activity options is determined for each agent according to the strategy it chooses and by considering its personal preference and social interactions with its peers. 

A linear programming model, integrated into the agent-based model, is then used to select an optimal activity for each agent to perform and generate an income value. Agents' satisfaction and uncertainty are updated accordingly. This sets the base for decision-making of next period.

### Running the ABM
After extraction into a jar file, run the program using the 'run_java_ABM.bat' batch file or directly from the command line. 

The ABM requires two additional commands to run: the number of years, and the specific model. For example:

	java -jar ABM.jar -year 5 -modelName WEEDCONTROL 

will start the ABM for five years running with the WEEDCONTROL gams model. 

Additional commands to fine tune the ABM simulation are available. The following flags turn off portions of the default simulation:
-uncertainty :: if set to 0, then ABM will not use the dissimilarity calculations during simulations
-individual_learning :: if set to 0, then the ABM will not use individual learning for activities during simulation
-social_learning :: if set to 0, then the ABM will not use social learning for activities during simulation
-activity_preference :: if set to 0, then the ABM will not use activity preference during simulation

### ABM Requirements
The initial conditions of the agents with all parameters need to be specified in the /data/ directory before starting the model. The /test_data/ folder contains example initialization files. 

The complete system documentation is available in the documentation folder. 

### Library Installation in Eclipse
Required libraries:
1. Download jgrapht-1.1.0.zip file from here: http://jgrapht.org/
2. Download commons-math3-3.6.1-bin.zip from here: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/download_math.cgi

Both of the those libraries should already be downloaded and included in the /lib/ directory. 

1. In Eclipse Open:
	Window->Preferences->java->Build Path->User Libraries 

2. Select "New" and input the name of the library:
	Either *jgrapht* or *commons-math3-3.6.1*
	
3. After creating the library, link the new library with the jar files.
	Select "Add JAR" and select the JAR files from the /lib/ folder in the project that correspond to the library name. 
	
4. In the main Eclipse window, right click on the "FARMIND" project and select "Build Path->Add Libraries".

5. In the window, select "User Libraries" and then select the newly created library. 

6. Refresh the project (F5) and compile.

### Java JAR File Extraction
To extract the required JAR file for the external MP model integration in eclipse do the following:

1. In eclipse right click on the /src/ folder and select 'Export' 

2. Under 'Java' select 'Runnable JAR File' and select 'Next'

3. Make sure the "Launch Configuration" is set to "FARMIND - Consumat" as the entry point for the program and make sure to select 'Extract required libraries' to ensure that the jar file is a stand alone file. 

4. Choose a file location and hit 'Finish'.

### Troubleshooting Guide
1. Issue related to graph library:

>Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problems: 
>	       Graph cannot be resolved to a type
>	       DefaultEdge cannot be resolved to a type
	       
To fix this issue ensure that you have installed all libraries as shown in the *Library Installation in Eclipse* section. 
If the issue persists, try removing the libraries and reinstalling them again.
	
2. Program hangs after printing "Waiting output generated by MP model":

	This is the expected program operation. It has generated the gams file and started the gams simulation. 
	The gams program will produce a results file for the ABM to process. Until then it will wait. 
	
	When the model is running in test mode, the batch file 'run_gams.bat' will copy a output file (stored in /data/ folder as 'Grossmargin_P4,00'). 

3. "Exiting Farmind. Input number of iterations."

	Input number of years (integer) required for the simulation when running the batch file

4. "Exiting Farmind. Input MP Model: WEEDCONTROL or SWISSLAND."
	
	Input which model you want the ABM to interface with during operations.
