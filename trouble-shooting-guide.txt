1. Issue related to graph library:
	
	Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problems: 
	       Graph cannot be resolved to a type
	       DefaultEdge cannot be resolved to a type
	       
	To fix this issue ensure that you have installed all libraries listed in the library_installation.txt file. 
	If the issue persists, try removing the libraries and reinstalling them again and this should fix the issues. 
	
2. Program hangs after printing "Waiting for gams results to be generated"
	This is the expected program operation. It has generated the gams file and started the gams simulation. 
	The gams program will produce a results file for the ABM to process. Until then it will wait. 
	Manually copy a results file into the main Farmade director (stored in /data/ folder as 'Grossmargin_P4,00') to simulate the gams output.
